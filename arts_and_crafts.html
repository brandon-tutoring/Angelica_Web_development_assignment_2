			<li> Mix the resin according to the package directions.  I only needed 6 drams (not quite 1 ounce) of mixed resin for these 3 spoons. Wear gloves and work in a well ventilated area. </li>

			<li> Use a stick to gently fill the spoon with resin.  The resin should fill the spoon and count on surface tension for the best look. </li>

			<li> Then be patient and let the resin dry completely–overnight should do it. </li>
